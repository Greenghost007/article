This is an article exchange system with two permissions: administrators and regular users. Regular users can send articles, read articles, and search other people's articles. Administrators can approve all users' articles.

Technically, the front-end uses the Vue framework, Pinia state management library, and Element-Plus component library. The back-end uses the Gin framework and Elasticsearch search engine.
